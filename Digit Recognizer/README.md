TITLE:
Digit Recognizer

ORGANIZATION:
Kaggle

WHEN:
November 2023 - April 2024

DESCRIPTION:
- MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

- In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

GOAL:
- The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.

- For every in the test set, you should predict the correct label.

METRIC:
- This competition is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of images you get correct).

FINAL SCORE:
submission: 0.97414
submission2: 0.98567
