This is an AI course selection assistant prototype I developed for the course named CTDL1902 - AI and Society: Ethics, Cognition, and Critical Analysis at HKUST. It's basically a RAG bot capable of answering questions related to course selection at HKUST based on the context provided in the context folder. All the relevant files are scraped from HKUST's official websites and the underlying RAG chain is built using LangChain and Huggingface.
